        <p class="lightGray noBottom">“I would like to highly recommend James Klein as a painter.  James is extremely professional, hardworking and honest, plus a pleasure to have working in my home. I asked for and received, extremely well itemized quotes in a timely manner for the different rooms that I wanted painted in my home. Each quote listed all the work to be done and the amount of paint to be used.  James arrived promptly each day at the time he said he would arrive and continued until the job was finished or it was the end of the day.  He worked fast, neatly and cleanly. I have had my home painted a number of times, and this was by far, my most pleasant experience.”<br><br>~Ann S.</p>
        <p class="grey noBottom whiteText">“James Klein has been doing different jobs for me for 4 or 5 years.  He has painted outside and inside, repaired fascia. He is always on time and cleans up when he is finished. I wouldn't hesitate to ask him to do any type of work on my house. I live in Moss Creek and I know he has done work for many other people in here. Don't hesitate to give him a call.”<br><br>~Linda M.</p>
        <p class="lightGray noBottom">“I am writing this letter in reference to James Klein. I had the privilege of having him dry wall two additions in my home. He was prompt, courteous, and professional. He made sure that the dust would be contained in the work area. Each room was left clean and tidy at the end of the day. The project was completed on time. I have recommended him to my friends and those that have used him were very satisfied.”<br><br>~Barbara R.</p>
        <p class="grey noBottom whiteText">“This letter is written to express my confidence, trust and support for James Klein as owner of a new small business named iPaint4U. I have worked with James on many occasions and most recently on a roof repair which was completed in a timely manner, done professionally and left clean. I know him to be prompt, honest and completes a job in total. He is someone with many years of experience painting and it shows in the above average quality of work he completes. It has been my pleasure to write this letter on his behalf.”<br><br>~Cheryl C.</p>
        <p class="lightGray noBottom">I am pleased to have been asked to write a recommendation for James Klein. Since my move to the South I have had the unfortunate experience where workers, in general, do not return calls, do not do the job as requested and show up only if it is convenient for them. James always returns calls. He is punctual. He does exactly what is asked of him and often more. He is a fine painter, does excellent carpentry work and his prices are fair. He finishes his work in a timely manner. He always cleans up after a project. Equally important, he is pleasant, courteous and kind. In recommending him, I know people will be highly pleased with him personally and with his work."<br><br>~Rica C.</p>
